## üèÅ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or later)
- npm
- MongoDB (local instance or a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas)

### Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/pentoshi007/t-finder.git
   cd t-finder
   ```

2. **Setup the Backend:**
   ```sh
   cd server
   npm install
   ```
   - Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory and add the following variables:
     ```
     MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
     JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
     PORT=3001
     ```
   - Start the backend server:
     ```sh
     npm run dev
     ```

3. **Setup the Frontend:**
   - In a new terminal, navigate to the `client` directory:
     ```sh
     cd client
     npm install
     ```
   - Create a `.env` file in the `client` directory and add the backend API URL:
     ```
     VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001
     ```
   - Start the frontend development server:
     ```sh
     npm run dev
     ```

Your application should now be running locally!
- Frontend: `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is busy)
